This app is for golfers so they may record their scores from each round. Golfers may create a user, and then choose
the ID of their user along with the ID of a golf course so they may play a round. When beginning a new round,
golfers may enter "0" for their scores until they have played that hole. If only playing 9 holes, they may
leave the score for the remaining 9 holes as "0." Golfers can look up other golfers and their IDs, along with the course
and their IDs as well. 

This app keeps track of the golfer's name, mobile, and email. The courses are tracked by their name and the
address of the course.
